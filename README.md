# FINFORGE

### Financial Forensics Investigation & Report Generator

**Author:** Tom Murphy
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** March 2026
**Target Completion:** Summer 2026

## Overview

FINFORGE is a digital forensics portfolio project simulating a real-world financial crime investigation. It combines manual artifact analysis using industry-standard forensic tools with a custom Python-based triage automation tool, culminating in a professional case report modeled after deliverables produced by firms like Kroll, FTI Consulting, and Ankura.

The project was built to demonstrate forensic investigative methodology, technical tool-building ability, and professional documentation standards to employers in the digital forensics and financial crime investigation space — before obtaining professional experience in the field.

## Scenario

A mid-level employee at a fictional wealth management firm is suspected of submitting falsified expense reports and exfiltrating confidential client data prior to resignation. A forensic image of the suspect's Windows workstation has been preserved following proper chain of custody procedures. This investigation reconstructs the suspect's activity, identifies relevant artifacts, and produces findings in a format suitable for legal and corporate review.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate hands-on proficiency with industry forensic tools: Autopsy, FTK Imager, Volatility3, and Wireshark
- Build a functional Python tool that automates artifact parsing and generates structured triage reports
- Produce professional documentation modeled after real consulting firm deliverables
- Create a forensics-specific portfolio piece targeting financial crime investigation roles

## Build Phases

**Phase 1 — Environment Setup** ✅ Complete

Established isolated forensic lab VM, installed all forensic tools, configured Python environment and libraries on host machine.

**Phase 2 — Scenario Design** 🔄 In Progress

Developing fictional financial crime case brief including suspect profile, alleged offenses, and investigation scope.

**Phase 3 — Manual Investigation**

Conducting artifact analysis on forensic image using Autopsy and FTK Imager. Documenting findings across browser history, prefetch files, LNK files, USB artifacts, and file system timeline.

**Phase 4 — Python Triage Tool**

Building `triage_generator.py` — a command-line tool that automates artifact collection from a forensic image and outputs a structured HTML triage report using Jinja2 templates.

**Phase 5 — Professional Case Report**

Producing a PDF case report formatted as a consulting firm deliverable. Sections include case overview, investigative methodology, findings by artifact category, activity timeline, and conclusions.

**Phase 6 — Publish & Promote**

Finalizing GitHub repository, writing LinkedIn content series documenting the build process, and adding project to resume.
